# FileMaker Object Archive

**AppleScript Script Menu Actions for FileMaker Pro**

## Archive Selected Items

This action allows you to store FileMaker objects.  You can store anything: scripts, script steps, layout objects, custom functions, tables. 

## Recover Archived Items

This is the companion to *Archive Selected items.* This action places an archived item onto the clipboard ready to be pasted back into a FileMaker database.
